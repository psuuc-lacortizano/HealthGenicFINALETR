                    </h1>
                    <p class="lead my-3 text-light">Everyone is familiar with high-protein diets, especially the Atkins
                      and zone diets, which have recently gained popularity, though they have been prevalent since the
                      1990s. Other diets like the caveman and paleo diets can vary in macronutrient ratios, but they are
                      typically high in protein. While the standard diet chart for keto focuses on fat, it can also be
                      relatively high in protein content. Protein is a significant macronutrient of a balanced healthy
                      diet as it aids in building and repairing muscles, organs, and bones. </p>

                      <h1 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1"><b>The Adequate Protein Consumption</b></h1>
                      <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2019 by <a href="#">Ado</a></p>

                      <p>The amount of protein consumed by men and women averages from 50-55 grams per day for women to
                        60-70 grams for men. For ordinary people (with little physical activity), the daily protein
                        intake recommendation is 0.8-1.0 grams per kg of body weight. When you eat more than this,
                        you’re on a high-protein diet. However, remember that not everyone requires the same amount of
                        protein. For example, for Elite athletes, protein consumption can be 3.5 grams as per kg of
                        their body weight without experiencing any adverse effects. And in the long run, most healthy
                        adults can tolerate 1.2 – 1.5 g of protein per kg of body weight per day.

                        All protein sources have a biological value number. However, as per the nutrient profiles,
                        animal protein ranks higher than plant protein. Therefore, if you want to meet your daily
                        protein requirement solely through a plant-based diet, you’ll need to eat a lot more plants
                        (nearly double) to match the protein from a smaller portion of animal-based food.</p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>The HealthifyMe Note</h4>
                      <p>High protein diets can help in reducing fat and promote weight loss. In addition, they leave
                        you feeling fuller for longer and support muscle retention. But where there are pros, there are
                        also cons. Thus, one must be aware of these high-protein diets’ risks.</p>

                      <h3 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1"><b>Best Sources of Protein</b></h3>

                      <p>When you choose what to eat among a variety of high-protein dishes, it is in your hands to
                        choose the healthier options. It will enable you to reduce the negative impacts of a
                        high-protein diet. There are various healthy protein sources, which include: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Grass-fed lean meats & poultry (pasture-raised)</li>
                        <li>Wild Fish</li>

                      <h3 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1"><b>High Protein Diet Side Effects or Risks</b>
                      </h3>

                      <p>Consuming an excess of anything can always be problematic to your health and life. The same is
                        in the case for high proteins. As per research, overconsumption can lead to dangerous side
                        effects and harm the body. On the other hand, there are potential health benefits for a
                        particular group of people. Still, for many people, excessively high amounts of protein for
                        prolonged periods will not go down well with your system. The various risks include:</p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>Weight Gain</h4>
                      <p>The weight loss process via high-protein diets is only for a brief period. The body stores the
                        excessive proteins as fat while the different amino acids excrete. However, it ultimately leads
                        to weight gain in the future if you consume too many calories under the pretext of enhancing
                        your protein intake. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>As per a study in 2016, when proteins replaced carbohydrates, it led to weight gain. However,
                        when proteins replaced fats, there was no significant weight gain.</p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>Bad Breath</h4>
                      <p>Bad breath is another problem associated with consuming too many proteins. It is due to a
                        metabolic state of the body called ketosis, where they release chemicals with an unpleasant
                        smell. Even flossing or brushing won’t solve your problem. You have to switch to healthy habits
                        and probably chew gum to eradicate some of the odour. </p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>Dehydration</h4>
                      <p>Consuming too much protein causes the kidneys to work twice as hard to flush it out through
                        urine, which makes you thirsty. As a result, you lose essential minerals such as magnesium,
                        potassium, and sodium. Therefore, even if you consume more protein, you must also ensure that
                        you consume various fruits and vegetables with high moisture and mineral content.</p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>Bowel Problems</h4>
                      <p>High protein diets can easily wipe out healthy gut flora because they lack pre-biotics, a fibre
                        that helps fuel beneficial bacteria. It can cause a wide range of bowel issues, the most
                        prevalent of which are constipation and diarrhoea. Stomach cramping and bloating are common. The
                        problem with high-protein diets that exclude carbohydrates is that they are low in fibre. Keep
                        track of your bowel movements and stay hydrated while eating fibre-rich diets. It is essential
                        for dealing with constipation. Multiple studies have declared that a high protein diet causes
                        bowel problems. However, the exact aetiology of bowel problems associated with higher protein is
                        not yet fully understood. </p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>May Cause a Nutritional Deficit</h4>
                      <p>A diet may be protein-rich but still lack essential micronutrients. Of course, your platter
                        should always get balanced to meet your body’s nutritional requirements. However, in cases where
                        the body receives excess proteins, it can lead to a metabolic strain on the liver, kidney, and
                        bones. In addition, it may lead to leaching out of nutrients from these organs, reducing the
                        overall biological nutrient balance. </p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>May Lead to Cardiovascular Problem</h4>
                      <p>A few high-protein diets comprise a higher intake of red meats and fattier proteins. But not
                        all proteins behave in the body in the same manner. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>According to research, plant protein leads to a lower mortality risk than animal proteins. It
                        suggested that plant proteins result in longevity, and daily consumption of around 3% of plant
                        proteins could diminish the risk of death by about 5%. </p>
                      <br>

                      <h3 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1"><b>The Benefits of a High Protein Diet</b></h3>

                      <p>Most people turn towards a high-protein diet to lose weight as it helps curb hunger or build
                        muscles. But, as per a study, it has other benefits as well. </p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>Fat Mass Reduction & Improvement in Lean Muscles</h4>
                      <p>As per literature reviewed in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, multiple analyses of
                        short-term and controlled feeding studies, high-protein diets focus on enhancing weight loss,
                        fat mass loss, plus a drop-in waist circumference for participants. In addition, the final
                        reports have also shown that you can preserve lean mass due to these high protein diets.
                        However, make sure to consult a nutritionist before you start implementing considerable amount

                      <h4>Lowers Triglyceride Levels</h4>
                      <p>A high protein diet will benefit people with type 2 diabetes because it lowers triglycerides
                        and fat lipids in the blood. Whereas in the case of a low protein diet, you can be prone to the
                        risk of cardiovascular diseases. </p>

                      <h4>Repair Tissues</h4>
                      <p>Proteins play a significant role in repairing tissues; hence, protein diets are great
                        recommendations for healing wounds & injuries. That is because the body seeks proteins as a
                        nutritional aid for wound healing, thus enhancing the requirement of proteins and calories in
                        the injured area.</p>

                      <h3 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1"><b>Are High Protein Diets Suitable for All?</b></h3>

                      <p>We all know that high protein diets are safe for healthy individuals and have no health
                        implications. But we should also be aware that these diets are not for everyone. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>You should follow a high-protein diet under the strict guidance of a medical consultant or
                        professional. However, you should not overload your body with excessive proteins and lead your
                        body to harmful implications or unwanted health issues. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Some protein choices you make for your body may not be healthy as they contain saturated fats,
                        which can raise cholesterol levels. In addition, it can be bothersome for your kidneys when you
                        consume too much protein. The pattern is such that there will always be negative consequences
                        for patients with a hiked cholesterol count or any renal dysfunction. Therefore, to
                        counterbalance this function, you must increase your water intake and not run the risk of
                        dehydration. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>You must determine if a diet is suitable or not for you first. Then, your doctor can guide you
                        through the various pros and cons of the process as per your individual needs and requirements.
                        But the most important thing is to eat a healthy, balanced diet and keep yourself engaged in an
                        active lifestyle. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Recognise and align your life goals and plans with your needs. For example, do you want to gain
                        muscle or lose weight? Do what is best for your health; your body can sustain it for longer.</p>

                      <h3 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1"><b>Are High Protein Diets Good for Weight Loss? What Do the
                          Experts Say?</b></h3>

                      <p>When healthy people follow a high-protein diet for a short period, it is not harmful and will
                        result in effective weight loss and leave you feeling satiated. But restricting carbs in a
                        high-protein diet for a longer time could result in severe health issues. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Studies to prove the same is still in motion. Very few carbohydrates in your diet lead to
                        nutritional deficiencies due to insufficient fibre. You could suffer from headaches and
                        constipation, along with the bad breath. Diets comprising red meat or full-dairy products can
                        take you closer to heart diseases. High protein diets make the kidney function worse as it
                        becomes a pain to eliminate the waste products of protein metabolism. Smartly choose your
                        proteins by including nuts, fish, beans, lean beef, pork, etc. You can also consume low-fat
                        dairy products. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>The quality of your carbs is also crucial. So, choose nutrient-dense and high fibre-complex
                        carbohydrates and chuck the processed carbs out of your diet. Always vouch for fresh fruits,
                        vegetables, and whole grains. Before starting a weight-loss diet, keep your health conditions a
                        priority, especially if you have diabetes or kidney disease. Weight loss may be temporary if you
                        cannot change your eating habits. Only start a plan if you can stick to a method for as long as
                        you get the best results. </p>
                      <br>

                      <h3 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
                      <p>You should take a lot of factors into consideration while planning your daily protein count.
                        These factors involve age, gender, activity, health, diet, and other variables. In the case of
                        adults, though, we consider the total body weight. It decides your daily protein intake. For
                        example, adults who shy away from physical activity should ideally consume 0.8 grams of protein
                        per kilogram of their body weight. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>If you are a weight-lifter or exercise frequently with body weights, you can freely consume up
                        to 1.2 – 1.7 grams of protein per kg. Elite athletes are privileged to consume around 3.5 g of
                        protein per kilogram of their body weight. Experts say that healthy adults can consume 2 grams
                        of protein per kilogram of body weight in the long run. </p>
